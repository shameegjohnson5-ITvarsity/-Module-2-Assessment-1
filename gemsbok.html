<p>
The chamois ( Oryx gazella ), not to be confused with the chamois ( Rupicapra rupicapra ), is a cloven-hoofed mammal from the family Bovidae. The scientific name of the species was published as Capra gazella in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus. The species is considered part of the informal group of antelopes. It occurs in Africa in arid regions such as the Kalahari and the Namib Desert.

Gemsbok are grass eaters. They can live for weeks without drinking water because they can retain it. They also absorb moisture from food. The urine is very concentrated. They live in herds of up to 25 animals, consisting mainly of females with young and a few males.
